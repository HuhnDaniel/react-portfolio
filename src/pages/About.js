                As a full-stack web developer, I use experience with multiple technologies to create
                intentional and engaging sites and applications.  Previous experience in leadership
                roles provides me with strong teamwork and communication skills necessary for working
                well in a group.  I pride myself in my sense of initiative for learning, my work ethic,
                and my ability to finish projects on time.
            </p>

                Proficient in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, back-end technologies
                such as MySQL and MongoDB, and libraries such as ReactJS, to make myself well rounded in
                my abilities to work with full stack applications.
